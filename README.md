# ExpoApp
A native mobile app using Expo SDKs - build a stopwatch mobile native application for both ios/android.

If you are doing any R&D for a native application or building an MVP/demo/blueprint mobile app, it will be a hectic process to configure SDKs by setting Xcode & Android studio first. 🤕

You will have to invest majority of time in the setting up part and I hate it :(

Do we have an alternate option where we can avoid this? Yes, we have — Expo

Expo is the savior. 🐱‍🏍

So to keep it short, below are the steps to build and run a mobile app within seconds from scratch -

* install expo on phone
* npx create-react-native-app appName
* cd appName
* npm start
* scan QR code in expo app (phone+computer should be on the same network)
